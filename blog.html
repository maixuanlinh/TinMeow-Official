                        <p>A few months ago, my family and I went to a nearby cat rescue shelter to get a kitten. There were
                            five in the available litter to choose from, but as we were watching them play, one of the two
                            tabbies boldly decided to scale a nearby sack of bedding, then promptly fell in head-first and
                            couldn&rsquo;t get out. Obviously, we had to have that idiot. And that&rsquo;s how we ended up
                            with Pickle.</p>
                        <p>Named by my five-year-old son for a character from Blaze and the Monster Machines, Pickle seemed
                            to have no fear whatsoever, immediately taking to playing with the kids, being manhandled by my
                            two-year-old daughter, and constantly attempting to sit on me while I&rsquo;m working. But
                            recently, after all his inoculations and &ldquo;other&rdquo; treatments, we had a cat flap
                            installed so he could go outside. We were honestly worried about him. He&rsquo;s growing fine
                            but is still quite slender; he&rsquo;s so young and small still, and there are a lot of other
                            cats and dogs in our street. Would the little guy be able to cope?</p>
                        <p>You know in The Dark Knight when Gotham City&rsquo;s all happy because the criminal element has
                            been tamed by Batman, then the Joker turns up and all hell breaks loose? It was a bit like that,
                            but with a cat. In the first two weeks of him being outside, Pickle had stared down and scared
                            off every (bigger, older) cat he could find, started and actually won several fights with next
                            door&rsquo;s (massive) dog, decided to use the neighbouring children&rsquo;s trampoline as a
                            toilet, and I recently saw him chase what looked to be two genuinely afraid teenage boys down
                            the street.</p>
                        <p>We also recently found a large tuna steak on our garden path. Still no idea where that came from.
                            So,
                            far from being a vulnerable, timid little ball of fur, Pickle seems to be an actual psychopath.
                            And possibly a master thief as well. Even by standard cat stereotypes, this is pushing it
                            somewhat. Such characteristics do not scream &ldquo;cute&rdquo;. But&hellip; look at his face!
                        </p>


                        <p>Yes, Pickle, a kitten, is still cute. All kittens are. But, why? Why are these miniature
                            monsters, with their aloofness, numerous spiky bits, and tendency to murder things and bring you
                            their mangled remains, so capable of triggering human empathy and adoration? They&rsquo;re not
                            even the same species as us! Countless people ask Google, &ldquo;Why are kittens so cute?&rdquo;
                            every day, so it&rsquo;s obviously a common question. Thankfully, science has provided a few
                            answers and explanations.</p>
                        <p>Much of the earliest work into cuteness as a scientific phenomenon began with the term
                            &apos;Kindchenschema&apos;</p>
                        <p>Part of it is the fur. Studies have shown that primates instinctively seek out, even need, soft
                            pleasant contact, preferably with our own parents and kin, but the basic tactile sensation will
                            do usually. This may stem from an evolved like of social grooming, and extremely rewarding and
                            influential practice among social mammals like us, so the very act of running your fingers
                            through the long soft fur of another being is likely something we respond to at a deep,
                            instinctive level, so any animal which seems to be all soft fur is going to be instinctively
                            more appealing. And kittens are exactly that. The Oatmeal&rsquo;s Matt Inman describes stroking
                            a kitten&rsquo;s tummy as &ldquo;like frolicking in the back hair of an angel&rdquo;, which
                            sounds just right. This may also explain why scaly or slimy creatures don&rsquo;t get the cute
                            label, but birds often get a pass, particularly the &rdquo;fluffier&rdquo; ones. Feathers are
                            nice and soft too, after all.</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s not just the fur though, obviously. Rats and mice have fur, but we have industries
                            dedicated to wiping them out. And tarantulas are technically furry, but&hellip;</p>
                        <p>Mini Dachshund sitting in stylish living room. Older and distinguished mini daxie puppy dog
                            sitting on hardwood floor in modern living room. Wrinkled brown fur matching colors of leather.
                        </p>
                        <p>So what else is it about kittens that trigger this cute reflex? Much of the earliest work into
                            cuteness as a scientific phenomenon began with Austrian scientist Konrad Lorenz who coined the
                            term &ldquo;Kindchenschema&rdquo;. As the name suggests, it basically proposes that the more
                            qualities and features something has in common with human babies, the cuter it&rsquo;s perceived
                            as being. For instance, babies have disproportionately large heads and eyes compared to their
                            eventual adult form, thanks to the uneven ways the brain and body develop. Kittens (and puppies)
                            also have large heads and huge eyes, so are considered cuter than the more evenly-proportioned
                            beady-eyed rodents nature provides us with.</p>
                        <p>Younger animals generally provoke this cuteness reflex more, even if the adult version is still
                            relatively small and fluffy. There are many theories as to where it comes from, or what
                            it&rsquo;s for, but it&rsquo;s a particularly potent one that &ldquo;hijacks&rdquo; many
                            neurological processes. Many argue that it stems from an evolved pressure to care for babies, as
                            human ones are so vulnerable and need constant care, so it&rsquo;s good for the species. It can
                            even go &ldquo;too far&rdquo;, where the cute reflex is powerful but regularly thwarted (due to
                            species, distance, cultural limits on what&rsquo;s acceptable interaction etc), and results in
                            aggressive elements being invoked (&ldquo;So cute I could just squeeze it/eat it up!&rdquo; and
                            so on).</p>
                        <p>Kittens seem to trigger a lot of the inherent reflexes in our brains that we&rsquo;ve acquired
                            over the millennia of evolution. Their furry small bodies with the huge heads and eyes tick all
                            the right boxes, so we find them so cute, we let them get away with murder. Literally.</p>
